Panda Challenge

Please review the files that are in the PyCitySchools folder. The complete ipynb is inside the folder.

After going through the course, I was able to understand Python-Pandas a little better although I have more to learn.  I decided to go back through this challenge to resolve the issues and try to complete it.

WRITTEN REPORT:
In this challenge, we combined to csv files to create a combined dataframe to use for analysis.  From this, several other dataframes were created.  
From the dataframe, here are some of the highlights:
* The hightest student count for the District type school is Bailey High School, while the hightest student count for the Charter type school is Cabrena High School
* The top 5 schools with the highest overall passing rate for math and reading were all Charter type.
* District schools have more in student enrollment, school budget, and per student cost but lower in overall pass rate for test scores.

Looking at the data, one would conclude that Charter schools out performs District schools in the area of test scores.  This could be attributed to lower student enrollment.
